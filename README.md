Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal game in the pantheon of early video games. Developed by
Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992
by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the
history of video games

Embodying the American spy Willian “B.J.” Blazkowicz, the player attacks and decimates
the Nazi army (and another army of zombies while he is at it) with the support
of destructive weapons one more lethal than the next. At the peak of the Story, William
finally faces off an Adolf Hitler, equipped with no less than four Gatling guns and a
robotic protective armor... A true wonder of storytelling, violence and historical details.

Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II
(Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996),
that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.

In this project I follow in the footsteps of this brillant programmer and write
my own version of Wolfenstein 3D... Hold on, we won’t ask you to re-write not the
ENTIRE Wolfenstein 3D. One has to be be realistic here. Your mission will be to write,
using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find
his/her way
